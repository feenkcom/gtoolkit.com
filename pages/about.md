          <p class="lead">Glamorous Toolkit is the environment for Moldable Development, a way of programming through contextual tools.
            Moldable Development is hard to convey in words. You have to experience it. Glamorous Toolkit is <a href="https://github.com/feenkcom/gtoolkit/blob/master/LICENSE">free and open-source</a> so you can do just that.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Glamorous Toolkit is developed by <a href="https://feenk.com">feenk</a> as part of a long term effort to make the inside of software systems explainable. We see the environment as a language with visual and interactive operators that can be combined in many ways to create and consume contextual narratives with and about every aspect of a software system. Creating these narratives leads to explainable systems.
