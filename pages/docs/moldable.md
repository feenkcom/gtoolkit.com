        <h1>Moldable Development in a nutshell</h1>
        <p>
          Everything about software systems is representable as data. Data does not have an intrinsic shape. It's just data. But, to reason about it, we, humans need a shape. That shape is provided by our tools.
        </p>
        <p>First, this means that tools are essential in software engineering. But, what kind of tools should they be?</p>
        <p>Consider this basic example of six objects viewed through the lens of a typical view showing the variables and corresponding values. This generic view is widespread. While its genericity makes it applicable to all objects, it also makes it bland. Distant. Uncomunnicative.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/pictures/moldable-inspector-raw.png"/></p>
        <p>Now, let's change the shapes. Same objects. Different shapes.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/pictures/moldable-inspector-custom.png"/></p>
        <p>These are not generic shapes. They are custom made. They only make sense for the objects they depict. Their specificity makes them humane and helps you engage.</p>
        <p>Everything in a software system, including individual objects, can be viewed from multiple perspectives, and we believe the environment should accommodate all these. We say it should be moldable.</p>
        <p>Glamorous Toolkit is built from the ground up to be a moldable development environment. For example, here is how the inspectors for our six objects look like. They are distinct, contextual.</p>
        <p><img src="/assets/pictures/moldable-inspector-all.png"/></p>
        <p>Changing the way we see our systems can have a dramatic impact on how we reason about our systems and it is applicable systematically through all our tools.</p>
        <p>We are developing Glamorous Toolkit to show concretely how this applies throughout the whole development cycle all the way from how we depict a single object to how we can steer agile architecture, or how we can explain whole systems to non-technical people.</p>
